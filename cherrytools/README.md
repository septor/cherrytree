## CherryQuick

This tool allows you to view exactly what you need for any number of Base Camp levels. You can enter entire ranges, 1-10, or any combination of levels; 1,3,57. The tool also allows you to view items needed for quests. You can view entire quest lines, or certain quest levels.

## CherryHunts

This one is a little more straight forward. Simply start typing whatever Treasure Hunt hint the game gives you and it'll narrow it down to what you need to be doing to complete your hunt.

## CherryRares

Start typing in a rare item, and you'll get what the item does and how to get it. The locations are sorted by best drop rate.

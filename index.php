The data used to generate materials you need is pulled directly from the <a href="https://cherrytree.wiki/">offical wiki</a>. If something there is incorrect, it will be incorrect here as well (duh). You can create an <a href="https://github.com/septor/cherrytree/issues/new">issue</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/septor/cherrytree">GitHub repo</a> I have set up for this if you notice something wonky.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, I hope everything here is as helpful to you as it is to me!</p>

# WARNING

The frontend work is *less* terrible. Thanks to ChatGPT I've gotten the layout semi-mobile friendly.

# CherryTree

You can view all the materials you need to complete the following:

* All of your Base Camp levels.

## Details?

* You can remove already completed base levels by selecting your current base level.

## Missing or invalid requirements

Submit an issue. The data is pulled from the Official Wiki of the game, so it's possible things there are outdated and I have bad information.

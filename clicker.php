<h2>AutoClicker Scripts!</h2>
<p>I don't have any scripts to post yet! You can either send me a PM on the CherryTree Discord, or open a new <a href="https://github.com/septor/cherrytree/labels/clickerscript">issue</a> with the clickerscript label.</p>
<p>If you're requesting a new script, be sure to include what AutoClicker it's for and for which platform!
